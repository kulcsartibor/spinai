## What is SpinAI?

SpinAI is a lightweight TypeScript framework for building AI agents that can:

- Execute actions in a specific order
- Maintain state between actions
- Make decisions using any LLM
- Handle complex dependencies

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Agents are the core of SpinAI. They:

- Receive user input
- Decide which actions to take
- Execute actions in the correct order
- Provide responses back to users

```typescript
const agent = createAgent({
  instructions: "Help users with support tickets",
  actions: [getCustomerInfo, createTicket],
  llm: createOpenAILLM({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
});
```

### Actions

Actions are discrete tasks that your agent can perform:

- Have clear inputs and outputs
- Maintain state through context
- Can depend on other actions
- Are executed in DAG order

```typescript
const getCustomerInfo = createAction({
  id: "getCustomerInfo",
  description: "Retrieves customer information",
  async run(context) {
    context.state.customer = await fetchCustomer();
    return context;
  },
});
```

### Context

Context flows through your actions:

- Preserves state between actions
- Carries the original user input
- Accumulates results as actions run

## Why SpinAI?

- 🎯 **Focused**: Built specifically for action-oriented AI agents
- 🔄 **Flexible**: Works with any LLM that supports chat completions
- 📦 **Simple**: Minimal boilerplate, maximum productivity
- 🛠️ **Type-safe**: Built with TypeScript for robust development
- 🪶 **Light**: Zero dependencies beyond your chosen LLM
